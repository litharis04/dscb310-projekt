# Rules for Jupyter Notebooks

1.  **DO NOT edit this file directly.** The Agent often corrupts the complex JSON structure of .ipynb files.
2.  **Target File:** Instead, look for the paired `.py` file (e.g., `EDA.py`) which uses Jupytext percent format.
3.  **Action:** Apply all edits to that `.py` file.
4.  **Sync:** The changes will be automatically synced to this notebook by Jupytext upon reload.
